	Typography can be a daunting prospect when it comes to designing for mobile devices, there are lots of discussions on the topic out there, many of which arrive at differing conclusions. So for a mobile web app project I’m currently working on I decided to brush up on my font sizing theory to ensure that everything we release passes mobile UX conventions.

%p
	First off, if you’re not doing anything particularly intensive, you can save yourself time and use the following, letting the devices and their browsers calculate the sizing on your behalf. 

%span.code
	font-size: small;<br />
	font-size: medium;<br />
	font-size: large;  

%p
	However this technique is unlikely to be anywhere near sophisticated enough to meet the designs many of us work with. Delving a little deeper, a common rule of thumb when dealing with fonts is to go no lower the 12pt (Apple’s

	actually specifies 13pt). Well that was easy, but wait, what exactly is a point? It’s true that a point size reference isn’t particularly helpful for web developers who, unlike print designers, will generally make use of pixels, or preferably ems. Do not fear though, there is a simple calculation that can be made to figure out the values: 

%span.code
	points / 0.75 = pixels
%p 
	or
%span.code	
	pixels * 0.75 = points  

%p
	So when its recommended never to use fonts smaller than 12pt, using the equation stated above we can deduce that the minimum font size we should be using is 16px. 

%span.code	
	12pt = 16px or 1em
